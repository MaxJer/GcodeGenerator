# GcodeGenerator

Use this code to generate Gcode for 3D printing scaffolds with continous strands (optimized for core-shell bioprinting). The user has full control over scaffold size (height and diameter), infll density/strand spacing, printing speed and extrusion rate. Furthermore, the Gcode to 3D print multiple scaffolds can be generatred with defined spacing between the individual scaffolds.
